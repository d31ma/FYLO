# Changelog

## 26.30.05-1 - 2026-07-24

### Added

- Every `ok: false` machine-protocol response now carries a stable, documented
  `error.code`: `EBADREQUEST` for request-shape/access/page validation
  failures, `EUNSUPPORTEDOP` for unknown operations, `EINVALIDDOCID` for
  invalid document IDs, and the deterministic `EUNKNOWN` fallback for
  unclassified engine failures (#79). The code set is additive and documented
  in the machine-interface README.

### Fixed

- The pinned `fylo-web.mjs` browser example in the client shim guide now
  references the current release instead of 26.30.04.

## 26.30.05 - 2026-07-24

### Added

- A machine-readable runtime identity: `fylo version --output json`,
  `--version`, and a side-effect-free machine `handshake` operation share one
  stable identity covering runtime/protocol versions, the immutable release
  commit and build target, CHEX/TTID requirements, effective frame limits, and
  capabilities.
- Bounded NDJSON machine-protocol frames with strict UTF-8, duplicate-key
  rejection, and configurable 1 MiB request / 8 MiB response limits (up to
  64 MiB), enforced symmetrically by all nine binary-backed language shims.
- Bounded query pagination for `findDocs`/`findDeletedDocs` over an immutable
  disk-backed snapshot with access-scoped, expiring cursors; shims expose
  `findDocsPage`/`findPage` in each language's casing.
- An exclusive crash-safe root-owner lease (`--exclusive-root`) backed by a
  kernel file lock with generation fencing; competitors fail closed with
  `EROOTLOCKED` and replaced owners with `EROOTLEASELOST`.
- POSTIX access context on every machine document and raw-file CRUD/query
  operation, including request-scoped trusted virtual groups for
  binary-backed applications; the Node shim exposes chainable `.as(...)`.
- Whole-root S3 backup, verification, status, reconcile, and restore through
  the standalone binary (`fylo backup verify|restore`, `backupStatus`,
  `backupReconcile`) with credentials confined to `AWS_*`/`FYLO_S3_*`
  environment variables.
- Windows NTFS backup/restore parity using platform-tagged v2 manifests that
  capture bytes, alternate-data-stream metadata, and native mode/mtime from
  one pinned descriptor; cross-platform-family recovery fails explicitly.
- A live S3-compatible release gate against pinned MinIO, native packaged
  macOS arm64/x64 lease verification, signed build provenance attestations,
  an SPDX SBOM per release, and opt-in `FYLO_VERIFY_PROVENANCE=1` installer
  verification.

### Changed

- Release executables are built through `scripts/build-executable.mjs`, which
  embeds the immutable release commit, target, and build kind; development
  builds report an unknown commit instead of silently claiming one.
- The standalone S3 restore wrapper `scripts/s3-restore.mjs` is replaced by
  `fylo backup verify` and `fylo backup restore`.

## 26.30.04 - 2026-07-23

### Added

- POSTIX group ownership and POSIX owner/group/other permission evaluation,
  backed by a trusted supplementary-group resolver with a short in-memory cache.
- A versioned, checksum-covered standalone Explorer ZIP for self-hosted web
  deployments.

### Changed

- Rust and Dart client shims, the machine protocol, SQL access writes, and
  documentation now support GID-aware access metadata.
- The marketing site now presents Explorer as a self-hosted release download
  instead of linking to it from the shared site header.

### Fixed

- Compiled `fylo exec --loop` processes now remain available after raw-file
  puts, restoring persistent Node and other binary-backed client sessions
  (#65).
- GID-only and mode-only writes preserve the document's existing ownership
  fields while applying the requested access change atomically.
- Secure Windows transaction-state replacement now tolerates short-lived
  antivirus/indexer access denials with a bounded retry while remaining
  fail-closed for persistent or unrelated errors.

## 26.30.03 - 2026-07-22

### Added

- POSTIX per-document POSIX access controls for macOS/Linux native clients,
  with UID-aware SQL access across the binary-backed language shims.
- Native Windows crash recovery and secure NTFS path handling validated on
  Windows Server 2022 and 2025.

### Changed

- Metadata now uses the fluent `put(...).metadata(...)` and
  `get(...).metadata()` API, with matching client-shim operations.
- Release inputs and GitHub Actions are immutably pinned, and the published
  Windows executable is the exact binary tested on Windows.

### Fixed

- Generated TTID collisions across concurrent processes no longer overwrite a
  first write; generated inserts retry atomically under the collection lock.
- Transaction-state replacement on Windows retains the validated file handle
  through the atomic rename, avoiding transient close/reopen failures.
- Fylo and Explorer navigation, standalone-domain routing, CSS, components,
  workers, and Wasm assets are preserved in their Amplify artifacts.

## 26.29.04 - 2026-07-16

### Breaking Changes

- Removed the HTTP gateway, `fylo serve`, REST/SSE browser synchronization, and
  `createSyncedClient`. Browser and mobile clients are local-only.

### Added

- Fluent developer metadata: `put(id, value).metadata(record)`,
  `put(id).metadata(record)`, and `get(id).metadata()`, with matching machine
  operations and language-shim methods.
- Raw-file buckets under `.buckets`, including rekeying, folder browsing,
  checksum verification, CLI `verify`, and migration from legacy file
  collections.
- Browser File System Access support and a standalone Fylo Explorer application
  that builds from `explorer/` for its dedicated `fx.del.ma` origin.
- Immutable, version-pinned browser loader and engine assets on GitHub Pages,
  with a checked `latest` alias and SHA-256 manifests.
- Built-in whole-root S3 backup with prefix-scoped reconciliation,
  mirror-on-write, bounded retries and concurrency, status/events, and a
  checksum- and xattr-verifying restore workflow.
- Checksum-addressed Amplify artifacts, production smoke probes, and
  checksum-verified rollback for the marketing and Explorer applications.
- Cross-platform metadata persistence: native xattrs on macOS/Linux, a locked
  and recoverable NTFS ADS manifest on Windows, and an OPFS sidecar in browsers.
- Durable VCS materialization transactions with object-hash verification,
  startup recovery, multi-process serialization, and crash-window tests.

### Security

- Reject symlink and reparse-point escapes throughout document, raw-file,
  metadata, and versioning paths.
- Hardened SQL/PostgREST maps against prototype pollution and replaced LIKE
  regular expressions with bounded linear matching.
- Added fail-closed mobile origin/asset allowlists, payload and pending-request
  limits, timeouts, cancellation, and renderer/load failure cleanup.
- Bounded Explorer preview, import, export, and upload memory use; removed FYLO's
  dynamic-evaluation loader.

### Fixed

- Metadata, rekey, initial raw-file writes, index updates, restore, and merge now
  roll back or recover atomically across injected failures and process crashes.
- Release assets are built and verified before draft publication makes the tag
  visible; failed drafts are cleaned up without moving an existing tag.
- macOS/Linux and Windows installers now fail closed unless the downloaded
  executable has exactly one valid matching SHA-256 entry.
- Client interop now covers metadata round trips/removal and mobile lifecycle
  failures without regenerating tracked Python bytecode.

## 26.28.04 - 2026-07-09

### Breaking Changes

- **Single `fylo` CLI command**: removed the documented dotted command surface (`fylo.admin`, `fylo.query`, and `fylo.exec`). Use `fylo inspect`, `fylo rebuild`, `fylo sql`, `fylo exec`, and the other normal subcommands instead.

### Changed

- Package bin metadata now exposes only `fylo`, keeping npm/binary installs aligned with the compiled executable and cross-language machine protocol.
- README and website examples now use the canonical `fylo <subcommand>` style exclusively.

## 26.28.02 - 2026-07-07

### Added

- **Language client suite** (`clients/`): drop-in, dependency-free clients that drive the compiled binary over the machine protocol — Python, Ruby, Node/TypeScript, PHP, Go, Rust, C#, Java, and Dart. Each exposes a named method per operation plus a collection-scoped facade — `db.collection("users").put(...)`, with `db.users.put(...)` sugar in the dynamic languages.
- **Local-first clients**: the browser bundle (`fylo-web.mjs`) and native iOS (Swift), Android (Kotlin), and Flutter clients embed the engine on-device (OPFS) and reconcile with a backend `fylo serve` over REST/SSE — fully offline-capable. The mobile and Flutter clients host the web engine in a headless WebView and share one RPC bridge (`clients/mobile/`).
- **Local-first browser sync** (`src/browser/sync/`): an OPFS-backed store with a background sync engine — push over the machine protocol, pull via an SSE changes feed (`GET /v1/:collection/events`), document-level three-way merge, and offline queueing.
- **Raw file storage**: store and read opaque files alongside documents (`src/core/raw-file.js`, `src/storage/files.js`).
- **Version-matched clients bundle**: every release attaches a `fylo-clients.tar.gz` (paired with that release's binary) alongside the platform binaries and the web bundle.

### Changed

- **CHEX and TTID are consumed as standalone binaries, not npm packages**: the engine spawns the `ttid` and `chex` binaries — installed from their GitHub Releases via `scripts/install-vendor-bins.sh` — through dependency-free vendored shims in `src/vendor/`, instead of importing `@d31ma/ttid` / `@d31ma/chex`. This keeps FYLO's distribution binary-first with a minimal dependency graph.

### Removed

- Bundled example-database fixtures (`examples/db/`) and the standalone `scripts/build.mjs` / patch scripts, superseded by the `build:exe` and `build:web` scripts.

## 26.25.01 - 2026-06-15

### Breaking Changes

- **Fluent facade sub-methods**: bulk and deleted-document operations moved under their base verb — `findDeleted(q)` → `find.deleted(q)`, `batchPut(b)` → `put.batch(b)`, `patchMany(u)` → `patch.many(u)`, `deleteMany(q)` → `delete.many(q)`. The deprecated method-first forms (`fylo.patchDocs`, `fylo.delDocs`, `fylo.batchPutData`) now point callers at the new names.
- **`joinDocs` renamed to `join`**: `fylo.join(spec)` replaces `fylo.joinDocs(spec)` (and the deprecated `Fylo.joinDocs` static). The machine/HTTP `joinDocs` operation name is unchanged.
- **Collections must exist before use**: `put`, `patch`, `delete`, `restore`, and reads (`get`, `find`) against an unknown collection now throw `CollectionNotFoundError` (`code: 'FYLO_COLLECTION_NOT_FOUND'`, HTTP 404) instead of silently auto-creating it. Call `fylo[collection].create()` first. `inspect()` still returns `{ exists: false }` without throwing. The error is exported from the package root and `@d31ma/fylo/browser`, and propagates across the browser worker protocol.

### Changed

- **Content-addressed, hierarchical version storage**: every document version is written once as a deduplicated blob under `.fylo-vcs/objects/`, and a commit's snapshot is a tree of content-addressed tree nodes mirroring the on-disk shard layout (collection → namespace → bucket → document). A commit's `tree.json` holds only the root tree hash (O(1)), and unchanged subtrees are shared by hash across commits and branches — no per-commit data duplication or full-tree copy. Restores and merges rematerialize documents from blobs and rebuild indexes.
- **Incremental single-document commits**: auto-commit passes the ids it changed, so a commit re-reads only those documents and rewrites only the tree nodes on their path to the root. Per-commit work is bounded by what changed rather than the collection size (a 10× larger collection still does the same work per single write), making sustained single-document write workloads scale linearly instead of quadratically. Manual `commit` falls back to a full scan and yields an identical root hash.
- **Auto-commit coalesces bulk operations**: `put.batch`, `patch.many`, `delete.many`, and `import` each record a single commit covering every document they touch, instead of one commit per document. Single-document writes still commit individually.
- **`put.batch` no longer drops failed inserts silently**: every item is still attempted, but if any fail it now throws `FyloBatchWriteError` (exported from the package root) carrying `writtenIds` (the documents that did land) and `failures` (`{ index, error }` per rejected item) so callers can recover the partial batch instead of losing it.
- **`sync.failed` observability event**: fire-and-forget replication failures now emit a `sync.failed` event (`{ collection, docId, operation, path, detail }`) to the `onEvent` handler in addition to logging, giving operators an inspection hook for the async sync pipeline.

### Security

- **Constant-time bearer-token check**: the HTTP gateway compared the `Authorization` token with `===` (timing-attack vector); it now uses `crypto.timingSafeEqual` over SHA-256 digests.
- **Internal errors no longer leak to clients**: HTTP 5xx responses return a generic `Internal server error` message (the detail is logged server-side), so filesystem paths and stack traces are no longer exposed. Intentional 4xx errors keep their helpful messages.

### Fixed

- `tsc --noEmit` is clean again (typed the certificate-pinning variable in `importBulkData`).
- **Multi-origin CORS**: an array `corsOrigin` previously emitted a spec-invalid comma-joined `access-control-allow-origin` header. The gateway now echoes the caller's `Origin` when it is in the allowlist (and omits the header otherwise); a single configured origin or `*` is still returned as-is.
- **Malformed request paths return 400**: an invalid document ID or collection name in a URL now responds `400` with the validation message instead of a generic `500`.

## 26.23.07 - 2026-06-07

### Breaking Changes

- **Method-first API removed**: `fylo.getDoc(c, id)`, `fylo.putData(c, data)`, `fylo.patchDoc`, `fylo.delDoc`, `fylo.findDocs`, `fylo.findDeletedDocs`, `fylo.restoreDoc`, `fylo.batchPutData`, `fylo.createCollection`, `fylo.dropCollection`, `fylo.rebuildCollection`, `fylo.inspectCollection`, `fylo.exportBulkData` (and their `static` forms) now throw a migration error. Use collection facades instead.
- **`fylo.db.<collection>` accessor removed**: the constructor returns a collection-facade Proxy, so collections are accessed directly on the instance — `fylo.users.get(id)`, `fylo['users'].put(data)`. `const { db } = new Fylo(...)` is no longer valid; use `const db = new Fylo('/path')` (the instance is the db).
- **`fylo.executeSQL(sql)` removed**: use the `` fylo.sql`...` `` template tag.
- **Facade method names finalized**: `get`, `latest`, `find`, `findDeleted`, `put`, `batchPut`, `patch`, `patchMany`, `delete`, `deleteMany`, `restore`, `export`, `import`, `inspect`, `rebuild`, `create`, `drop`. (Previous facade exposed the old method-first names such as `getDoc`/`findDocs`.)
- **Reserved collection names fail closed**: names that collide with FYLO internals or removed methods (`sql`, `as`, `db`, `ready`, `close`, `engine`, `cache`, `queue`, `getDoc`, `putData`, …) are rejected by `validateCollectionName` and cannot be created or addressed.

### Changed

- **`AuthenticatedFylo` (RLS via `fylo.as(auth)`) is collection-first**: returns a Proxy exposing the same facade methods (`scoped.posts.find(...)`); scoped SQL runs through the authorized facades, preserving every `doc:*` authorization and row-visibility check.
- **Full JSDoc typing** across the facade API, CLI machine interface, HTTP gateway, and browser runtime; `tsc --noEmit` is clean. Factory helpers (`createFylo`, `createMachineFylo`, `fyloFor`) and the `fylo[collection]` access points are typed via a `FyloCollections` intersection.

### Fixed

- **Browser client**: `inspectCollection`/`rebuildCollection` now call the correct `FyloBrowser` methods (previously called non-existent `inspect`/`rebuild`); `get().onDelete()` no longer `yield*`s a `Promise`.
- Removed a dead duplicate `batchPutData` implementation on the `Fylo` class.
- README examples updated to the facade API (`db.users.patch`, `db.users.find`, `db.users.delete`, `db.posts.rebuild()`) and corrected the Quick Start construction (`const db = new Fylo('/path')`).

## 26.23.05 - 2026-06-05

### Added

- **Browser-native per-document runtime**: `@d31ma/fylo/browser` preserves FYLO's per-document layout over OPFS or an injected VFS instead of storing a collection blob.
- **Default browser client**: `@d31ma/fylo/browser` exports an app-author friendly default client so browser code can call `fylo.<collection>.putData(data)` directly. It prefers OPFS and falls back to memory when OPFS is unavailable.
- **Browser worker runtime**: real browser contexts prefer `SharedWorker`, fall back to `DedicatedWorker`, and multiplex FYLO cores by namespace. Collection subscriptions fan out to every subscribed port in the same namespace.
- **Browser-safe filesystem core**: added `FyloFilesystem`, `MemoryFilesystem`, `BrowserDocuments`, `BrowserPrefixIndex`, `BrowserEventBus`, and a browser-safe query engine under `src/browser/core`.
- **Browser conformance coverage**: tests now verify per-document storage, tombstones, prefix index files, worker request correlation, cross-port subscription fanout, and clean browser bundles without Bun/Node/server-cipher leakage.
- **Document version control**: `fylo checkout [-b] <branch>`, `fylo branch`, `fylo commit -m <message>`, and `fylo log` add Git/Dolt-style branch isolation with S3-style full collection snapshots under `.fylo-vcs`.
- **Document version-control diffing and restore**: `fylo status`, `fylo diff`, and `fylo restore-commit <commit-id>` compare payload snapshots and safely restore commits with a dirty-tree guard.
- **Document version-control merges**: `fylo merge <ref>` supports fast-forward merges and conservative three-way document-payload merges, with structured conflict reporting when both sides changed the same TTID differently.
- **Machine version-control operations**: `exec --request` now supports `checkout`, `branch`, `commit`, `log`, `status`, `diff`, `restoreCommit`, and `merge` so compiled-binary consumers can drive the same version-control flow from any language.
- **Remote HTTP gateway**: `fylo serve` exposes a PostgREST-inspired HTTP boundary over a local FYLO root with bearer-token auth, URL-based filtering, branch profiles via `Accept-Profile`/`Content-Profile` headers, and an embeddable `createFyloHttpHandler` export under `@d31ma/fylo/server`.
- **Compiled binary interop**: CI now verifies the compiled `fylo` binary against Python, Ruby, PHP, Dart, Java, C#, C++, Swift, Kotlin, and Rust callers.

### Notes

- Browser support is intentionally JavaScript-first because JavaScript already runs natively in browsers. OPFS or memory filesystem adapters execute reads/writes, while the browser core owns validation, document mutation, prefix indexing, query execution, and the worker protocol.
- Document version-control snapshots are whole `.collections` copies, not diffs. This favors auditability and recovery over storage efficiency for the first production-safe implementation.
- Version-control diffs intentionally compare live and tombstoned document payload files only. Indexes, events, locks, and file metadata are excluded from diff noise.
- The HTTP gateway uses a single shared bearer token (like PostgREST). Loopback binding without a token is allowed; non-loopback binding without auth fails closed at startup.

## 26.22.07 - 2026-05-31

### Breaking Changes

- **Constructor is path-first only**: use `new Fylo('/path/to/db', options)`. The old `new Fylo({ root })` form and `fylo://` protocol strings are rejected so CLI, JS, and machine-call consumers all share one executable-friendly calling convention.
- **Collection facades added as the primary ergonomic API**: `fylo.db.<collection>` exposes collection-scoped methods such as `getDoc`, `findDocs`, `putData`, `patchDoc`, `delDoc`, `findDeletedDocs`, and `restoreDoc`. Collection names that collide with reserved FYLO properties fail closed.

### Added

- **SQL template tag**: `const { sql } = new Fylo('/path')` supports scalar interpolation with SQL-string escaping and delegates to the existing FYLO SQL executor.
- **Query result caching**: opt-in `cache` configuration supports memory and Bun Redis backends with `cache-aside`, `read-through`, `write-through`, and `write-around` strategies.
- **Redis configuration**: FYLO checks `cache.redis.url`, then `FYLO_REDIS_URL`; if neither is provided, Bun's native Redis client resolves `REDIS_URL`, `VALKEY_URL`, or localhost.
- **Stampede protection**: identical in-process cache misses are single-flighted so concurrent hot queries share one storage/index lookup.

### Changed

- Query caching stores matched TTID lists only and always hydrates documents from canonical FYLO storage files, avoiding decrypted document payloads in Redis.
- Collection cache invalidation is version-based. Mutations bump a per-collection cache version and old Redis keys expire naturally by TTL.
- CLI and machine-interface constructors now use the same path-first API as JS consumers.
- README and production fixture docs now show path-first construction, `sql` usage, collection facades, and cache configuration.

## 26.22.03 - 2026-05-27

### Breaking Changes

- **WORM mode renamed**: `worm: { mode: 'append-only' }` is now `worm: { mode: 'strict' }`. Strict mode rejects updates and deletes outright — the previous append-only-with-lineage model is gone.
- **`worm.deletePolicy` option removed**: there are no delete modes anymore; strict WORM refuses deletes.
- **Storage layout change**: collection directories no longer contain `heads/` or `versions/`. Soft-deleted document payloads are retained as `0444` files under `.deleted/<bucket>/<id>.json` and use the file `mtime` as `deletedAt`.
- **Legacy guard fail-closed**: opening any collection that still has `heads/` or `versions/` files throws `Collection '<name>' contains unsupported legacy WORM <dir> metadata; migrate or remove legacy versions before opening it`. Operators with prior WORM collections must clear the legacy directories (or rebuild from `docs/`) before this release will mount them.
- **`fylo.getHistory()` removed** along with the `FyloHistoryEntry` type — versions are no longer materialized. Equivalent introspection: query the live document with `getDoc`/`getLatest` and the retained tombstones with `findDeletedDocs`.
- **Machine interface**: `getHistory` operation removed; `findDeletedDocs` and `restoreDoc` operations added.
- **`patchDoc` preserves the TTID**: an update no longer mints a new version id. Callers that captured the return value of `patchDoc` will continue to work because the returned id is unchanged from the original — but any code that relied on the previous "v1 vs v2 id" distinction must adapt.
- **`rebuildCollection` result shape**: `headsRebuilt`, `versionMetasRebuilt`, `staleHeadsRemoved`, `staleVersionMetasRemoved` fields removed. Result now reports `indexedDocs` only.

### Added

- **`findDeletedDocs(collection, query?)`**: query soft-deleted documents under `.deleted/`. Supports the new `$deleted` `TimestampQuery` filter alongside the standard query DSL.
- **`restoreDoc(collection, id)`**: move a tombstoned payload back into `docs/`, restore `0644` permissions, rebuild its indexes, and emit a live insert event. A tombstoned TTID cannot be written directly; it must be restored.
- **CLI**: `fylo deleted <collection> [--root <path>] [--json]` lists retained tombstones; `fylo restore <collection> <doc-id> [--root <path>] [--json]` restores one.
- **`$deleted` timestamp query operator** for filtering tombstones by deletion time.
- **`DeletedDocsResult` type** mirroring `FindDocsResult` (without `onDelete`, which is meaningless for tombstones).
- **Storage primitives**: `FyloStorage` gains `move`, `chmod`, `setModifiedTime`, and `metadata` so the deletion path can atomically move + lock + timestamp tombstones without round-tripping through application code.

### Changed

- **Soft-delete is the only delete path**: `delDoc` and `delDocs` move payloads into `.deleted/` rather than removing files. Hard deletion of tombstones is intentionally out of scope for this release; operators who want true erasure can `rm -rf .collections/<name>/.deleted/` between rebuilds.
- **Rebuild simplified**: `rebuildCollection` rebuilds the prefix index from live docs only. Tombstones are not re-indexed (they are queried via their own path).
- **Sync envelope**: strict WORM emits the initial write sync event only; mutation callbacks cannot occur because updates and deletes are rejected.
- `examples/db/.collections/<name>/.deleted/.gitkeep` placeholders added so the tombstone directory shape is captured in version control.

### Notes for RLS users

- `AuthenticatedFylo` (the `.as({...})` wrapper) does not currently expose `findDeletedDocs` or `restoreDoc`. Calling either through a scoped instance throws `TypeError: ... is not a function` — fail-closed but not explicit. Use the unscoped `Fylo` for tombstone introspection until a scoped surface lands.

## 26.21.06 - 2026-05-23

### Added

- **Auto-bootstrap collections from `FYLO_SCHEMA`**: `new Fylo(...)` now scans the schema directory and creates any collection that has a `manifest.json`. Existing collections are untouched (creation is idempotent).
- **`fylo.ready()`**: awaits startup bootstrap. Mutation and query methods already await internally; this is only needed for synchronous probes against `inspectCollection` before a write has been issued.
- **`globalThis.Fylo`**: the package entry registers the default `Fylo` class on the global scope using nullish coalescing. Enables preloaded-runtime usage without changing the module API for existing consumers.
- Regression test `tests/integration/global.test.js` for the global registration.

### Changed

- **Test layout**: `package-contract/` moved under `tests/package-contract/`. The default `test` script is now scoped to `tests/integration tests/collection` so it does not auto-discover the blackbox suite (which requires a build first). `test:blackbox` filter updated to `tests/package-contract`.
- **Build**: `tsc -p tsconfig.build.json` runs with `--noCheck` (type checking is still enforced by `bun run typecheck`). The bundled `dist/types/index.d.ts` now declares `Fylo` on the global scope to match the runtime registration.
- Dependency: `@d31ma/chex` bumped from `^26.21.2` to `^26.21.6`.

### Fixed

- **Schema guardrail**: FYLO now rejects arrays of objects in schema definitions with a clear error (`FYLO schema '<name>' does not support arrays of objects at '<path>'`), even though CHEX accepts them. Use a separate collection for nested object lists. Arrays of scalars and nested objects (as fields) remain supported.
- **`Fylo.defaultRoot()` and `FilesystemEngine` constructor default both fall back to the data dir when `FYLO_ROOT` is the empty string** (previously only fell back when unset). Without this, the new bootstrap would write collections to `./.collections/` at the caller's `process.cwd()` when `FYLO_ROOT=` was exported by a launcher.
- `tests/integration/filesystem.performance.test.js` no longer constructs a placeholder `Fylo` at module load time. The placeholder did nothing useful and would trigger the bootstrap with an empty root under the new behavior, even when the suite was skipped.

## 26.21.02 - 2026-05-19

### Changed

- **Env var rename**: `FYLO_SCHEMA_DIR` replaced by `FYLO_SCHEMA`. A `schemaEnv()` / `syncChexSchemaEnv()` bridge module (`src/schema/env.js`) syncs the value to `CHEX_SCHEMA_DIR` for CHEX compatibility.
- **Schema file convention**: Versioned schema files renamed from `<name>.json` to `<name>.schema.json`.
- **Test schemas consolidated**: Removed `tests/schemas/` directory; tests now use `examples/db/schemas/` as the single source of truth.
- **Internal readability**: Variable names improved across the codebase (e.g., `selCol` → `selectedCollection`, `res` → `response`, `delCol` → `deleteCollection`).
- **Workflow files**: Whitespace-only reformatting of CI and publish workflows.

### Added

- `CliRuntimeOptions` class for mutable CLI runtime formatting options shared across command handlers.
- Schema env bridge module (`src/schema/env.js`) providing `schemaEnv()` and `syncChexSchemaEnv()`.
- CRLF-terminated local index line reading support with integration test.
- Example collection schema validation test confirming `examples/db/schemas/` schemas match seeded data.

## 26.20.07 - 2026-05-17

### Breaking Changes

- Filesystem collection data now lives under
  `<root>/.collections/<collection>/` instead of `<root>/<collection>/.fylo/`.
- The local filesystem index directory is now `index/` instead of `local-fs/`.
- Local queue data now lives under `<root>/.queue/` instead of
  `<root>/.fylo/queue/`.

### Added

- Added `examples/db`, a production-shaped FYLO fixture with seeded `users`,
  `orders`, and queue directories.
- Integration tests now seed database roots from `examples/db` through
  `createTestRoot()`.

### Fixed

- Added a snapshot-file fallback for platforms where `Bun.mmap()` is not
  available, preserving local index reads on Windows.

## 26.18.28 — 2026-04-28

Major release. All backwards-compatibility surface removed; codebase
reorganised into a domain-driven folder structure. There are no new
runtime features beyond what shipped in the 2.x hardening pass — this
release is greenfield-only and intended for fresh deployments.

### Breaking Changes

#### Constructor / root options

- `s3FilesRoot` and `filesystemRoot` constructor options are removed.
  Use `root` instead.
- `FYLO_S3FILES_ROOT` and `FYLO_FILESYSTEM_ROOT` environment variables
  are removed. Use `FYLO_ROOT` instead.

#### Encryption

- The AES-CBC legacy read path (`Cipher.legacyCbcKey`) is removed.
  Documents encrypted before v2.1.1 (CBC mode) cannot be decrypted by
  this release. No migration path is provided; this is a greenfield
  release.

#### Write-operation options

- The `{ wait: false }` option on `putData`, `patchDoc`, and `delDoc`
  is removed entirely. Passing `options` to these methods previously
  threw a descriptive error; callers now receive a standard
  `TypeError: ... is not a function` if they call the old three-argument
  form through a stale binding.
- `rollback()` is removed from both `Fylo` and `ScopedFylo`. It was a
  no-op placeholder since the async-queue era was dropped.

#### Queue / dead-letter tombstone stubs

The nine stub methods that were kept solely to emit descriptive errors
are gone: `queuePutData`, `queuePatchDoc`, `queueDelDoc`,
`processQueuedWrites`, `getJobStatus`, `getDocStatus`, `getDeadLetters`,
`getQueueStats`, `replayDeadLetter`.

#### SSRF guard moved off the class

`Fylo.normalizeImportOptions`, `Fylo.assertImportUrlAllowed`,
`Fylo.isPrivateIPv4`, `Fylo.expandIPv6`, `Fylo.isPrivateAddress`,
`Fylo.hostAllowed`, and `Fylo.DEFAULT_IMPORT_MAX_BYTES` are no longer
static members of the `Fylo` class. They are now named exports of
`src/security/import-guard.js` (or `dist/security/import-guard.js`).

#### Source / import paths (dist consumers)

The source tree has been reorganised from a flat-ish layout to a
domain-driven structure. If you imported from internal paths, update:

| Old path                            | New path                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `src/adapters/cipher.js`            | `src/security/cipher.js`      |
| `src/sync.js` (events)              | `src/observability/events.js` |
| `src/sync.js` (sync/worm)           | `src/replication/sync.js`     |
| `src/engines/filesystem.js`         | `src/storage/engine.js`       |
| `src/engines/filesystem/durable.js` | `src/storage/durable.js`      |
| `src/engines/filesystem/fs-lock.js` | `src/storage/fs-lock.js`      |
| `src/engines/filesystem/storage.js` | `src/storage/primitives.js`   |
| `src/engines/filesystem/types.js`   | `src/storage/types.js`        |
| `src/engines/types.js`              | `src/storage/types.js`        |
| `src/core/format.js`                | `src/cli/format.js`           |
| `src/core/directory.js`             | `src/storage/index-keys.js`   |

### Security

- **SSRF guard with reason codes.** `importBulkData` classifies and
  reports rejected URLs as `protocol`, `host`, `private-network`, or
  `redirect`. Private/loopback/link-local IPv4 + IPv6 ranges are blocked
  by default; off-host redirects are rejected after the first hop.
- **`FYLO_CIPHER_SALT` is fail-closed.** When a collection schema requires
  encryption (`$encrypted` fields) and `FYLO_CIPHER_SALT` is missing, FYLO
  refuses to configure the cipher rather than silently deriving a
  default. Deployments must set `FYLO_CIPHER_SALT` explicitly before any
  encrypted write or read.
- **Multi-address pinning.** When a host resolves to multiple addresses
  (dual-stack, multi-A), `importBulkData` now tries them in order
  rather than failing on the first unreachable IP. Each candidate is
  still pinned and TLS-verified against the original hostname.
- **Redacted import URLs in events.** `import.blocked` events emit a
  redacted URL (no userinfo, query, or fragment) so observability
  pipelines do not leak pre-signed URL params or basic-auth credentials.

### Durability

- **Atomic lock create.** `tryAcquireFileLock` uses `link()` from a
  pre-populated temp file rather than `open(wx)` + `write`, closing a
  window where a concurrent reader could observe an empty lock.
- **Stale-lock takeover is observable.** Reclaimed stale collection or
  document write locks emit a `lock.takeover` event with the previous
  owner.
- **Heartbeat on collection write locks.** Long-running operations
  (`rebuildCollection`, bulk writes) refresh the lock timestamp every
  `ttlMs/3` while held, so legitimate work past the TTL is no longer
  misclassified as stale and taken over by another process. The default
  collection-write TTL is now 5 minutes, leaving generous margin for
  GC pauses or slow filesystems before any takeover is considered.
- **Stale-takeover revalidation.** Before unlinking a stale lock, the
  takeover path re-reads its metadata immediately prior to the unlink
  and aborts if another process has already updated the lock — closing
  a window where two acquirers could race-unlink each other's freshly
  created locks.
- **Write-lane leak fixed.** `withCollectionWriteLock` now releases its
  in-process write lane even if the underlying collection-lock
  acquisition or release throws, preventing the lane from getting
  permanently stuck pending under transient filesystem errors.

### Performance

- **Index writes amortized.** Collection index updates are batched
  within a single write lane, eliminating O(n²) behavior on bulk
  imports and rebuilds.

### Observability

- **`onEvent` hook on the `Fylo` constructor.** Receives a discriminated
  union of structured events:
    - `import.blocked` — `{ reason, url, detail? }`
    - `cipher.configured` — `{ collection }`
    - `index.rebuilt` — `{ collection, docsScanned, indexedDocs, worm }`
    - `lock.takeover` — `{ lockPath, newOwner, previousOwner? }`

    Throwing handlers are caught and logged to `console.error`; they do
    not break the underlying operation.
